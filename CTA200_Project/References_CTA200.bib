title = {The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) for the Spitzer Space Telescope},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) is one of three focal plane instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. IRAC is a four-channel camera that obtains simultaneous broadband images at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm. Two nearly adjacent 5.′2 × 5.′2 fields of view in the focal plane are viewed by the four channels in pairs (3.6 and 5.8 μm; 4.5 and 8 μm). All four detector arrays in the camera are 256 × 256 pixels in size, with the two shorter wavelength channels using InSb and the two longer wavelength channels using Si:As IBC detectors. IRAC is a powerful survey instrument because of its high sensitivity, large field of view, and four-color imaging. This paper summarizes the in-flight scientific, technical, and operational performance of IRAC.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {The Spitzer Space Telescope, NASA's Great Observatory for infrared astronomy, was launched 2003 August 25 and is returning excellent scientific data from its Earth-trailing solar orbit. Spitzer combines the intrinsic sensitivity achievable with a cryogenic telescope in space with the great imaging and spectroscopic power of modern detector arrays to provide the user community with huge gains in capability for exploration of the cosmos in the infrared. The observatory systems are largely performing as expected, and the projected cryogenic lifetime is in excess of 5 years. This paper summarizes the on-orbit scientific, technical, and operational performance of Spitzer. Subsequent papers in this special issue describe the Spitzer instruments in detail and highlight many of the exciting scientific results obtained during the first 6 months of the Spitzer mission.}

title = {Midcourse Space
Experiment Survey of the Galactic Plane},
journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) surveyed the entire Galactic plane within |b| ≤ 5° in four mid-infrared spectral bands between 6 and 25 μm at a spatial resolution of ∼18.″3. The survey was redundant within |b| ≤ 4.°5 with four-fold coverage over two-thirds of the area. These survey data were combined to create 1680 1.°5 × 1.°5 images that cover the region with 6″ pixel spacing in each of the spectral bands. The images preserve the inherent resolution of the data but have up to twice the sensitivity of a single scan. The individual survey observations had to be extensively conditioned to achieve the co-add advantage. The noise equivalent radiance (NER) at 8.3 μm, the most sensitive MSX mid-infrared spectral band, varies from ∼1.3 MJy sr-1 in the inner Galaxy to 3 times that at the latitude limits in the outer Galaxy; the sensitivities of the other MSX mid-infrared bands are 10–25 times less. Additionally, 36 lower resolution 10° × 10° images were generated in each band that span the full latitude and longitude range of the survey. These panoramic images have a resolution of ∼1.′2 with 36″ pixel spacing and a six-fold improvement in NER, making them an ideal product for comparison with radio surveys of the Galactic plane. An ancillary set of images has been created from other MSX astronomy experiments that lie within 10° of the Galactic plane. These images either extend the latitude coverage of the survey or provide deeper probes of Galactic structure either by themselves or when added to the survey images.}
